# Backend Cleanup Checklist

This document outlines potential improvements and cleanup tasks for the backend codebase. These tasks are for future consideration and should be reviewed by the team before implementing.

## Code Organization

- [ ] Move route handlers from `main.rs` to separate modules
- [ ] Create dedicated middleware module
- [ ] Separate business logic from HTTP handlers
- [ ] Implement a proper layered architecture (controllers, services, repositories)
- [ ] Create dedicated configuration handling module

## Database Improvements

- [ ] Add proper indexing for frequently queried fields
- [ ] Implement database migrations system for version control
- [ ] Add database connection retry logic
- [ ] Optimize query patterns for common operations
- [ ] Add database transaction support for multi-step operations

## Error Handling

- [ ] Implement consistent error handling pattern
- [ ] Create custom error types
- [ ] Improve error messages and logging
- [ ] Add request ID to track errors across the system
- [ ] Implement proper error responses with helpful messages

## Security Enhancements

- [ ] Add rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- [ ] Implement proper CSRF protection
- [ ] Review and enforce secure cookie settings
- [ ] Add input validation for all API endpoints

- [ ] Add account lockout after failed login attempts
- [ ] Audit logging for security-sensitive operations

## Testing Improvements

- [ ] Add unit tests for all business logic
- [ ] Implement integration tests for API endpoints

- [ ] Implement proper signal handling for graceful shutdown
- [ ] Review and update Docker security settings

## Documentation Code Comments

- [ ] Add documentation comments to public functions
- [ ] Document complex algorithms
- [ ] Add module-level documentation
- [ ] Ensure consistent commenting style

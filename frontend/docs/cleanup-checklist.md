# Frontend Cleanup Checklist

This document outlines potential improvements and cleanup tasks for the frontend codebase. These tasks are for future consideration and should be reviewed by the team before implementing.

## Code Organization

- [ ] Move middleware code to a separate module
- [ ] Create dedicated module for route handlers
- [ ] Implement a more structured application configuration system
- [ ] Improve logging with structured logging formats
- [ ] Refactor static file handling for better flexibility

## Client-Side JavaScript

- [ ] Consider bundling JavaScript files with a build tool
- [ ] Implement component-based architecture for UI
- [ ] Add client-side validation library for forms
- [ ] Improve error handling in API client
- [ ] Add proper loading states for asynchronous operations
- [ ] Consider implementing a simple router for SPA-like navigation

## HTML/CSS

- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile devices
- [ ] Create a consistent design system/component library
- [ ] Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)

- [ ] Optimize CSS with a preprocessor like Sass
- [ ] Implement proper font loading and optimization

## Error Handling

- [ ] Implement consistent error handling pattern

## Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Add caching for static assets
- [ ] Implement compression middleware
- [ ] Optimize image loading with responsive images
- [ ] Add lazy loading for non-critical resources
- [ ] Implement server-side rendering for initial pageload
- [ ] Add performance monitoring

## Dependency Management

- [ ] Review and update dependencies
- [ ] Consider pinning dependency versions
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] Audit dependencies for security vulnerabilities

## Docker Improvements

- [ ] Optimize Docker image size
- [ ] Improve Docker build caching
- [ ] Configure health checks
- [ ] Implement proper signal handling for graceful shutdown
- [ ] Set up multi-stage builds for different environments
- [ ] Add Docker Compose profiles for different use cases

## Documentation Code Comments

    <h1>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</h1>

    <h2>1. Service Scope</h2>
    <p><strong>Whoknows</strong> is a search platform that allows users to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Search a wide range of topics, similar to standard internet search
        engines.
      </li>
      <li>Create personal user accounts to log in and manage their profile.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The platform currently provides
      <strong>search functionality and basic account management only.</strong>
      There are
      <strong
        >no different account types, premium tiers, or additional
        services</strong
      >
      at this time.
    </p>
    <p>
      External API access (such as weather or other data services) is
      <strong>not available</strong> under this agreement but may be considered
      for future development.
    </p>
    <p>
      The service is <strong>globally accessible</strong> with no regional
      restrictions, and there are <strong>no enforced usage limits</strong> for
      users.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Performance Metrics</h2>
    <p>
      The Whoknows platform is intended to remain continuously available for the
      duration of the project period, which runs until <strong>June 26</strong>.
      While no formal uptime percentage is guaranteed, the service is expected
      to operate without interruption throughout this timeframe.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are currently no scheduled maintenance windows, and the platform
      does not enforce any response time guarantees. However, every reasonable
      effort will be made to maintain a responsive and stable experience for
      users.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Response Time</h2>
    <p>
      The Whoknows platform does not provide any formal guarantees regarding
      response times for searches, logins, or other user actions. However, the
      team actively monitors performance and aims to provide a responsive
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>As part of ongoing performance efforts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The <strong>landing page</strong> is targeted to load within
        approximately <strong>500 milliseconds</strong> under normal conditions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Other pages on the site aim to respond within approximately
        <strong>200 milliseconds.</strong>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These figures are <strong>goals rather than commitments</strong>, and
      actual performance may vary depending on network conditions and other
      external factors.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>
      Whoknows is committed to maintaining a secure environment for its users.
      The following measures are in place to help protect data and user
      accounts:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        All data transmitted between users and the platform is secured using
        <strong>HTTPS (SSL/TLS encryption)</strong> to ensure safe transit.
      </li>
      <li>
        User passwords are <strong>securely hashed</strong> before being stored,
        following best practices to prevent unauthorized access.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      While Whoknows implements technical safeguards,
      <strong
        >users are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their
        account credentials</strong
      >
      and ensuring their accounts remain secure (for example, by choosing
      strong, unique passwords).
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time, Whoknows does not maintain formal backup procedures for data
      recovery.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Compliance Standards</h2>
    <p>
      Whoknows collects only the minimum data necessary for users to create and
      access an account. This includes a
      <strong>username, email address, and password</strong>. No personal names
      or sensitive personal data are collected.
    </p>
    <p>
      User data is used solely for the purpose of enabling login functionality
      and account access.
      <strong>Data is not sold, shared, or used for any other purposes.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      While Whoknows does not currently fall under any specific legal compliance
      frameworks such as GDPR or CCPA, it aims to follow basic principles of
      user privacy and responsible data handling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users are responsible for ensuring that their use of the platform complies
      with any
      <strong>applicable local laws or institutional policies</strong> that may
      apply to them.

Monitoring Realization - Key Requirements & Prompts:
Focus: The documentation should describe a "grand realization" that your group had as a result of implementing and observing your monitoring system.
Content:
Write a "small section."
Detail something specific that your monitoring data/metrics made you realize about your system.
Explain what you subsequently fixed or changed in your system based on this realization.
Underlying Goal: The purpose is to demonstrate that your metrics gathering was successful in providing a new dimension of understanding about your system. You need to show how monitoring led to actionable insights and improvements.
Essentially, you need to tell a story:
What did you monitor?
What unexpected or important insight did this monitoring provide?
What action did you take based on this insight?
How did this action improve your system?

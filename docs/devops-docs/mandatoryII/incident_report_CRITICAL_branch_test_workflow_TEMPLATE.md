# Incident Report: Critical Misconfiguration of branch-test Workflow

**1. Incident ID:** `INC-DEBUGGER-DEMONS-YYYYMMDD-001` *(Please update YYYYMMDD with actual date)*

**2. Title:** Critical: Branch Test Workflow (`cd.branch-test.yml`) Misconfigured to Deploy to Production Environment/Port

**3. Date & Time of Incident:** `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC` *(Specify when the misconfiguration was active or last problematic run occurred)*

**4. Date & Time of Detection:** `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC` *(Specify when the team discovered the issue)*

**5. Severity:** **Critical**

**6. Status:** `Investigating` *(Update as appropriate: e.g., Resolved, Monitoring)*

**7. Lead Investigator(s):** `[Team/Individual Names]`

**8. Affected Services/Systems:**
    *   Production Environment (or a staging/dev environment sharing critical resources like ports with Production).
    *   Application deployed by `cd.branch-test.yml`.
    *   CI/CD Pipeline Integrity.

**9. Impact Summary:**
    *   **Actual Impact:** *(Describe if any unvetted code from a branch *was* deployed to the production port, causing issues, downtime, data corruption, or incorrect behavior. If no actual impact, state "No direct production impact confirmed from unintended deployment, but high potential risk identified.")*
    *   **Potential Impact:** Deployment of untested, unreviewed code directly from feature branches (e.g., `some-branch`) to the live production port, bypassing Pull Request approvals and associated quality checks. This could have led to:
        *   Service disruptions or outages.
        *   Data integrity issues.
        *   Security vulnerabilities.
        *   Reputational damage.
        *   Complex rollback procedures.

**10. Detailed Description:**
    The `cd.branch-test.yml` GitHub Actions workflow, intended for deploying test branches to an isolated development or testing environment, was discovered to be configured in a way that could (or did) deploy directly to the production server using the production application's port. The workflow is triggered on pushes to specific branches (as defined in its `on:` trigger, e.g., `some-branch`), meaning deployments could occur without a formal Pull Request, merge, or the associated approvals and quality checks that are integral to the `development` or `main` branch deployment processes.

    The workflow utilizes environment variables and secrets prefixed with `DEV_` (e.g., `DEV_SERVER_HOST`, `DEV_SERVER_PORT`, `DEV_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, `DEV_ENV_FILE_CONTENT`) and specifies `ENV_FILE: .env.development` and `DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE: ./docker-compose.dev.yml`. The core issue is that these "DEV" configurations were effectively pointing to the production environment's host and port, or an environment insufficiently isolated from production resources.

    Specifically, if the `secrets.DEV_SERVER_HOST` was the production server's IP/hostname, and the `HOST_PORT_FRONTEND` variable within the `secrets.DEV_ENV_FILE_CONTENT` (which populates `.env.development` used by `docker-compose.dev.yml`) was set to the production application's port, this established a direct and high-risk deployment path from non-mainline branches to production.

**11. Timeline of Events:**
    *   `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC]`: `cd.branch-test.yml` workflow initially created or last modified with the problematic configuration.
    *   `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC]`: (If applicable) Workflow last triggered by a push to a monitored branch, potentially deploying to the production-like environment.
    *   `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC]`: Misconfiguration of the workflow's deployment target and environment variables detected by the team.
    *   `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC]`: Investigation initiated.
    *   `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM UTC]`: `cd.branch-test.yml` workflow manually disabled as an immediate containment measure.
    *   *(Add other relevant steps as they occur: confirmation of production state, secret value verification, configuration correction, etc.)*

**12. Root Cause Analysis (RCA):**
    *   **Primary Cause:** Misconfiguration of critical environment variables and secrets (`DEV_SERVER_HOST`, `DEV_SERVER_PORT`, content of `DEV_ENV_FILE_CONTENT` specifically `HOST_PORT_FRONTEND`) within the GitHub Actions settings for the `cd.branch-test.yml` workflow. The "development" target environment specified was not distinctly separate from the "production" environment, especially concerning network host and port allocation.
    *   **Contributing Factors:**
        *   **Lack of True Environment Isolation:** Insufficient separation between development/testing and production infrastructure configurations within the CI/CD system. The `DEV_` prefixed variables did not guarantee deployment to an isolated dev environment.
        *   **Configuration Oversight:** The deployment target configuration for `cd.branch-test.yml` was not adequately reviewed or tested against a safe, isolated environment before being made active or during subsequent modifications.
        *   **Ambiguity in "DEV" Environment:** The `DEV_` prefix for secrets may have led to an incorrect assumption that these were pointing to a safe, isolated development environment, while their actual values targeted production resources or a shared, non-isolated environment.
        *   **Absence of Deployment Safeguards:** Lack of robust checks or manual approval steps within the `cd.branch-test.yml` workflow to prevent deployments to unintended or critical environments.
        *   **Shared Port Numbers:** Using or potentially using the same `HOST_PORT_FRONTEND` across different environment configurations intended for the same physical host.

**13. Resolution Steps (Taken or In Progress):**
    *   **Immediate Actions Performed:**
        1.  The `cd.branch-test.yml` workflow was manually disabled in GitHub Actions to prevent any further unintended deployments.
        2.  Verification of the current state of the production application (confirming no unvetted code from `some-branch` is currently active on the production port). *(Specify outcome)*
        3.  Initiated review of GitHub Actions secrets: `DEV_SERVER_HOST`, `DEV_SERVER_PORT`, `DEV_ENV_FILE_CONTENT` and compared them with their `PROD_` counterparts. *(Specify findings)*
        4.  Inspected `docker-compose.dev.yml` and its interaction with the environment variables, particularly `HOST_PORT_FRONTEND`.

    *   **Planned Short-Term Fixes:**
        1.  **Correct Configuration or Decommission:**
            *   **Option A (Reconfigure):** If `cd.branch-test.yml` is to be reinstated, it *must* be reconfigured to point to a **completely isolated** and non-critical testing environment. This requires dedicated secrets (e.g., `BRANCH_TEST_SERVER_HOST`, `BRANCH_TEST_SERVER_PORT`, `BRANCH_TEST_ENV_FILE_CONTENT`) that define this safe environment.
            *   **Option B (Decommission):** If its functionality is redundant or the risk outweighs the benefit, permanently remove the `cd.branch-test.yml` workflow.
        2.  **Ensure Distinct Environment Files:** Guarantee that `.env.production`, `.env.development`, and any future `.env.branch-test` files (or their secret-injected contents) have truly distinct values for critical parameters like `HOST_PORT_FRONTEND`, database connections, and external service URLs.

**14. Preventative Measures & Action Items (To be implemented):**
    *   **Enforce Strict Environment Segregation:**
        *   **Action:** Audit and document current infrastructure. Plan and implement changes to ensure complete network, host, and port isolation for production, development, and dedicated testing/branch-test environments.
        *   **Owner:** `[Team/Individual]` **Due Date:** `[YYYY-MM-DD]`
    *   **Granular Configuration Management:**
        *   **Action:** Define and use separate sets of GitHub Secrets for each distinct deployment environment (e.g., `PROD_SERVER_HOST`, `DEV_SERVER_HOST`, `BRANCH_TEST_SERVER_HOST`). Avoid reusing "dev" secrets for different types of non-production deployments if their targets differ.
        *   **Owner:** `[Team/Individual]` **Due Date:** `[YYYY-MM-DD]`
    *   **Mandatory CI/CD Workflow Reviews:**
        *   **Action:** Update team development guidelines to require mandatory peer review for all changes to CI/CD workflows (`*.yml` files). Reviews must explicitly verify deployment targets, environment configurations, and secret usage.
        *   **Owner:** `[Team/Individual]` **Due Date:** `[YYYY-MM-DD]`
    *   **Implement Workflow Safeguards:**
        *   **Action:** Investigate and implement GitHub Actions deployment environments with protection rules (e.g., required reviewers, wait timers) for any workflow deploying to an environment, including staging and development.
        *   **Owner:** `[Team/Individual]` **Due Date:** `[YYYY-MM-DD]`
    *   **Standardized Naming Conventions:**
        *   **Action:** Establish and enforce clear naming conventions for environments, configuration files, and secrets that leave no ambiguity about the target.
        *   **Owner:** `[Team/Individual]` **Due Date:** `[YYYY-MM-DD]`
    *   **Test Deployment Workflows:**
        *   **Action:** Implement a process for thoroughly testing new or modified deployment workflows against a dedicated, non-critical "meta-test" environment before they are allowed to target any actual development, staging, or production environment.
        *   **Owner:** `[Team/Individual]` **Due Date:** `[YYYY-MM-DD]`
    *   **Regular Audits:**
        *   **Action:** Schedule periodic audits (e.g., quarterly) of CI/CD configurations and environment secrets to ensure continued compliance and identify potential misconfigurations.
        *   **Owner:** `[Team/Individual]` **Due Date:** `[Ongoing, first by YYYY-MM-DD]`

**15. Lessons Learned:**
    *   The distinction between "development" and "production" configurations must be absolute and verifiable at the infrastructure level, not just in naming.
    *   CI/CD automation, while powerful, introduces risks if not meticulously configured, reviewed, and safeguarded.
    *   Secrets management requires clear organization per environment to prevent accidental cross-contamination.
    *   "Deploy on branch push" workflows, even for testing, need extremely careful target management to avoid unintended consequences on shared or critical infrastructure.
    *   A proactive approach to reviewing and testing CI/CD changes is as crucial as reviewing application code changes.

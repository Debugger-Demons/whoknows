# Mandatory II

## Reflection

### Branch Strategy & security

Since the start of the project we used is Git Flow.
It was decided on that branch due to past experience, and the simplicity for release management.

The strategy has been followed so for every feature that has been built is a feature branch from the development branch, and will only be merged if another developer from the team approves the PR so we can ensure that the code has been read through and makes sense for the other developer.

It has ensured that unwanted code and bugs will not reach the development branch accidently, and therefore made the team more courageus when working across teams with these safety measures.

# Legacy Codebase Analysis - Critical Issues

## Critical (Severe Security Vulnerabilities)

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**

   - Direct string interpolation in SQL queries throughout app.py
   - Affected routes: /api/login, /api/register, search
   - Example: `"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '%s'" % username`
   - Impact: Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands

2. **Weak Password Security**

   - Admin username and password is not in an environmental variable, and can be accessed through GitHub repository

3. **No Input Validation/Sanitization**
   - Raw user input used directly in queries
   - No content-type enforcement

## High Priority (Major Technical Debt)

4. **Outdated Dependencies**

   - Python 2.7 (EOL since 2020)
   - Flask 0.5 (current version 3.0+)
   - Werkzeug 0.6.1
   - Jinja2 2.4
   - Impact: No security updates, incompatible with modern tools

5. **Poor Error Handling**

   - Bare except blocks
   - System exit on database connection failure
   - No proper logging mechanism
   - Impact: Difficult debugging, poor reliability

6. **Environmental Issues**
   - Hard-coded environmental variables

## Medium Priority (Architectural Problems)

7. **Configuration Management**

   - Hardcoded configuration values
   - Development key hardcoded
   - Impact: Security risks, deployment difficulties

8. **Code Organization**

   - Mixed concerns in app.py
   - No separation of business logic (no service layer)
   - Lack of proper MVC structure
   - Impact: Poor maintainability

9. **Testing Inadequacies**
   - Incomplete test coverage
   - Missing integration tests
   - Impact: Reliability issues

## Low Priority (Improvement Opportunities)

10. **Documentation Gaps**

    - Limited inline documentation
    - No API documentation
    - Missing deployment guides
    - Impact: Knowledge transfer difficulties

11. **Frontend Integration**

    - No frontend folder
    - Static file handling issues
    - Impact: Poor file architecture

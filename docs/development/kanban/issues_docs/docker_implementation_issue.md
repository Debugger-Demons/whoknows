# Implement Docker Container for WhoKnows Backend

## Context
Currently, the application requires manual script execution and environment setup. Dockerizing the application will improve consistency, portability, and deployment reliability.

## Current Setup
- Location: `src/Rust_Actix/backend/Scripts/`
- Main script: `init_script.sh` which:
  - Updates the application
  - Runs the application continuously

## Requirements

### Docker Implementation Tasks
1. Create Dockerfile in `src/Rust_Actix/backend/`
2. Dockerfile should:
   - Use appropriate Rust base image
   - Copy necessary files and scripts
   - Set up required permissions
   - Execute init_script.sh as entrypoint
   - Expose necessary ports

### Additional Configuration
1. Create .dockerignore file
2. Update documentation with Docker usage instructions
3. Create docker-compose.yml for easy deployment
4. Add health checks

### Testing Requirements
1. Test container builds successfully
2. Verify init_script.sh executes properly
3. Confirm application updates work within container
4. Validate continuous running functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Container builds without errors
- [ ] Application runs continuously in container
- [ ] Update mechanism works within container
- [ ] Documentation updated with Docker instructions
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No root user in container
- [ ] Proper port exposure
- [ ] Health check implemented

## Technical Notes
- Base image suggestion: rust:1.75-slim
- Consider multi-stage build for smaller image size
- Implement proper logging
- Set up proper user permissions

## Labels
- DevOps
- Docker
- Infrastructure
- High Priority

## Resources
- Current init_script.sh location: `src/Rust_Actix/backend/Scripts/init_script.sh`
- Application source: `src/Rust_Actix/backend/`
